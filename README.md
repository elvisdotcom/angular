Adding CSS Animations #AngularJS
=======

AngularJS is meant for building rich data bound applications on the web. Adding animations to these applications feels just like having your favorite pizza with toppings. Animations not only add beauty to the UI, but they also make it more user friendly. A small animation in an app may elevate its richness to a level which is otherwise very difficult to achieve.

With the power of the web these days, there are several ways to create animations. Until fairly recently, the animations were possible only with JavaScript. But now that we have CSS3 supported well by all the major browsers, we can animate our sites with just CSS.

Animations were supported in AngularJS in version 1.1.5 beta. It underwent a number of changes before a stable version of the feature was released in AngularJS 1.2. Animation support in an Angular application can be added or removed very easily. The library brings very good support for both CSS based and JavaScript based animations. Though animations can be written in JavaScript, it is recommended to use CSS animations. This is because CSS animations are treated with low priority by the browser, and they donâ€™t block the processing thread when the thread could be doing something important.
